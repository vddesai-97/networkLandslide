## Contents: 
This package creates a geospatial network using poisson sampling and delaunay Triangulation. It takes information that you supply and outputs a multilayer network. This multilayer network can then be run into a community detection algorithm, specifically GenLouvain (CITE/LINK), with specifications that you provide to output communities. In this package, there is code to run the community detection algorithm, as well as code to quantify the results of the communities.
