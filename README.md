## Contents: 
This package creates a geospatial network using poisson sampling and delaunay Triangulation. It takes information that you supply and outputs a multilayer network. This multilayer network can then be run into a community detection algorithm, specifically GenLouvain (CITE/LINK), with specifications that you provide to output communities. In this package, there is code to run the community detection algorithm as well.
